we need a reason why this analysis is important!

we need an effective way of comparing performances.
- accuracy?
- precision? 
- recall? 
- why is a given metric a good one?

a chart comparing the score by model in a line graph? 
a chart comparing the MSE by model in a line graph?

i think we need to look into PCA....

how do we know which model is the best?
What can be said about the data based on which features were the most important, but especially based on which models were the best?

we have, like, 10 features. is there any way we can plot our models using a specific pair of them, or to find some that are related in important, meaningful ways?
do the feature importances of a given model play a role in its comparison against other models?


IDEA:
do we want to run a test circuit on a SEPARATE dataset from somewhere else with the same features using the top 3 models from our training gamut?
